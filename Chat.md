[2023-10-05 14:30] Reviewed the provided documents for material and media pricing. The SWITCHMaterial.txt and SWITCHMedia2.txt files contain detailed pricing structures for various materials and media types. These will be integrated into the inventory management system for accurate pricing calculations. The integration will involve implementing functions to calculate costs based on dimensions and material/media type. This will ensure that the application can provide accurate pricing for inventory items. Please review and let me know if there are any additional requirements or considerations. -Dev2
